**<h2 text-decoration='underline'>Overview</h2>**
This project is premised on a fictional online retalier - Atelier Fashions - which has requested a comprehensive rebuild of the back end of their e-commerce site, inclusive of the server, controllers and database. The project team is also tasked with migrating the existing data from the old system and for delivering the data in a form that fullfills the contract with the front-end requirements. The overall product must be deployed on Amazon EC2 instances with at least two stand-alone servers and a load balancer to reduce the bottlenecks and latency related to high volume of server traffic. Accordingly, the overall system must be load tested prior to delivery to the client, Atelier Fashions.
